 **"Reconstructing Systematically Missing NDVI Time Series in Cropland: A GAN-based Approach Using Optical and SAR Data"**

We propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method to reconstruct systematically missing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series, leveraging the complementary characteristics of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data.
